Working on an R package that takes a fasta sequence file and a reference sequence as input.

Compares the rest of the sequences to the reference sequence.

Outputs nucleotide differences between the sequences in a matrix.

  - 1 for a match
  - 0 for a mismatch

The matrix is then represented in a heatmap.
